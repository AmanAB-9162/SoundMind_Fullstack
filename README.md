## Troubleshooting

- **403 Forbidden from Spotify:**  
  - Check your Spotify credentials in `.env`.
  - Make sure the track is available in your region.
  - Try a different track.
  - Ensure your Spotify app is set to use the "Client Credentials" flow (no redirect URI needed).

- **400 Bad Request:**  
  - Make sure you are submitting a valid Spotify track URL.
  - The request body should be JSON: `{"track_url": "<spotify-track-url>"}`.

- **OpenAI errors:**  
  - Check your OpenAI API key in `.env`.
  - Ensure you have enough quota.
  - Make sure your OpenAI account is active and not rate-limited.

- **CORS errors:**  
  - Make sure both servers are running and CORS is enabled in the backend.
  - The frontend should use the correct backend URL (`http://localhost:8000/mood`).

- **Environment variables not loading:**  
  - Ensure your `.env` file is in the correct directory (`backend/`).
  - Restart the backend server after editing `.env`.

- **Frontend not connecting to backend:**  
  - Check that the backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`.
  - Make sure the fetch URL in your frontend matches the backend endpoint.

- **General debugging tips:**  
  - Check your browser console and backend terminal for error messages.
  - Use tools like Postman or curl to test your backend endpoints directly.
  - If you change dependencies, re-install with `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `npm install`.
